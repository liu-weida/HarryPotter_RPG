# HarryPotter_RPG

Once completed Harry Potter-themed PRG mini-game.

Based on java and javaFX.

Sort of a personal practice piece for learning java and javaFX.

Completely open source (although I don't think anyone will use it ahaha)

If you want to see how the game works you can just run the existing jar file in the library.
